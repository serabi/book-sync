## What is this?

If you listen to audiobooks on a regular basis on [Audiobookshelf](https://www.audiobookshelf.org/) or [Storyteller](add link)during the day and then pick up the same book via KoReader or Kobo before bed, you know how frustrating it can be to find your place in the book. 

The goal of Book Stitch fixes that. It's a self-hosted, Docker based sync engine that links your audiobook position to the matching spot in the ebook (and vice versa), then pushes that position to every app you use. It works by transcribing a segment of the audiobook audio and fuzzy-matching it against the EPUB text. Once that alignment map is built, converting between a timestamp and a page position is instant.

Major kudos and credit goes to [abs-kosync-bridge](link) for being the inspiration for this project. This project is a fork of that project, revamped with more of a focus on tracking _what_ you read. It can also work as a bridge between ABS and Hardcover.app, for example. 

### Supported platforms

| Platform | What it does |
|---|---|
| [Audiobookshelf](https://www.audiobookshelf.org/) | Main audiobook server |
| [KOReader](https://koreader.rocks/) (via KoSync) | E-ink reader progress (Boox, Kobo, jailbroken Kindle, etc.) |
| [Storyteller](https://smoores.gitlab.io/storyteller/) | Audiobook companion app with synced EPUB |
| [Booklore](https://github.com/booklore) | Ebook library and shelf manager |
| [Hardcover](https://hardcover.app/) | Book tracking service (write-only) |

You can use as few or as many of the above services as you want. None are required to use the app.

## Quick start

```yaml
services:
  book-stitch:
    build: .
    container_name: book_stitch
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      - TZ=America/New_York
    volumes:
      - ./data:/data           # Database, cache, logs
      - /path/to/ebooks:/books # Your EPUB library
    ports:
      - "4477:4477"            # Web dashboard
```

Start the container, open `http://your-server:4477`, and configure everything from the settings page. No environment variables needed beyond `TZ` — all settings live in the web UI and persist in the database.

**Please note that this service is not designed to be exposed outside a local area network.**

## How it works

Book Stitch runs three sync layers simultaneously, from fastest to slowest:

1. **Instant sync** — Listens to Audiobookshelf's Socket.IO stream and KOReader's KoSync updates in real time. When you pause an audiobook or close your e-reader, Book Stitch picks up the change within seconds.

2. **Per-client polling** — Lightweight checks against individual services (Storyteller, Booklore) at their own intervals. Only triggers a sync when the position has actually changed.

3. **Scheduled full sync** — A background sweep every few minutes that catches anything the other layers missed.

When a position change is detected, Book Stitch converts it to every other format (timestamp to percentage, percentage to EPUB position, etc.) and pushes updates to all connected clients. A write-tracker prevents feedback loops — if Book Stitch just pushed a position to a client, it ignores the echo that comes back.

## The alignment process

The first time you link an audiobook to its EPUB, Book Stitch needs to build an alignment map. Here's what happens:

1. A segment of the audiobook is transcribed using [Whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper) (local), [Deepgram](https://deepgram.com/) (cloud), or [Whisper.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp) (external server).
2. The transcript is fuzzy-matched against the EPUB text to find corresponding positions.
3. The resulting map is cached. After this, position conversion is instant — no re-transcription needed.

You can use a local Whisper model (runs on CPU or NVIDIA GPU) or offload to a cloud provider. The `tiny` model works fine for most books and runs quickly even on modest hardware.

---

## Split-port mode

Book Stitch can expose the KoSync API on a separate port from the admin dashboard. This keeps the sync endpoint available to your e-reader over the internet while the dashboard stays on your local network.

**Important:** Port 4477 (the dashboard) must stay on your LAN. Only the `KOSYNC_PORT` is safe to forward.

### Setup

```yaml
environment:
  - KOSYNC_PORT=5758
ports:
  - "4477:4477"   # Dashboard — LAN only, do NOT forward
  - "5758:5758"   # Sync API — safe to expose
```

### TLS requirement

KOSync credentials travel in HTTP headers (`x-auth-key`). Before exposing the sync port to the internet, put a reverse proxy with TLS in front of it (nginx, Caddy, Traefik, etc.). Without TLS, credentials are sent in plaintext.

### Public URL configuration

After setting up your reverse proxy, go to **Settings > KOSync** and enter your public URL (e.g. `https://sync.example.com`) in the **Public URL** field. This value is saved to the database and displayed on the settings page for easy copying into KOReader.

The **LAN Address** field shows `http://<server-ip>:<KOSYNC_PORT>` automatically — use this for devices on the same local network.

### KOReader setup

1. Set `KOSYNC_PORT` in your Docker environment
2. Configure your reverse proxy to forward `https://your-domain` to port `KOSYNC_PORT`
3. In Book Stitch settings, enter the public URL
4. In KOReader: Settings > Cloud storage > Progress sync > Custom server > enter your public URL

### Security features

The sync endpoint includes rate limiting, input validation, and MD5-hashed authentication per the KOSync protocol spec. Admin/management endpoints require credentials when accessed from public IPs.

## Ebook sources

Book Stitch needs access to your EPUB files for alignment. Three options, in order of simplicity:

- **Mount a volume** — Point `/books` at your EPUB directory. Simplest approach.
- **Booklore** — Book Stitch fetches EPUBs through the Booklore API. No volume mount needed.
- **Calibre-Web Automated (CWA)** — Same idea, fetches EPUBs through CWA's API.

## Building

### Docker (recommended)

Clone the repository and build the image:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/serabi/book-stitch.git
cd book-stitch
docker build -t book-stitch .
```

Copy the example compose file and edit it for your setup:

```bash
cp docker-compose.example.yml docker-compose.yml
# Edit docker-compose.yml with your volume paths, timezone, etc.
docker compose up -d
```

The dashboard will be available at `http://localhost:4477`. All service configuration is done from the Settings page in the web UI.

#### GPU support

To enable NVIDIA GPU acceleration for Whisper transcription, pass the `INSTALL_GPU` build arg. This adds ~800MB to the image for the CUDA libraries.

```bash
docker build --build-arg INSTALL_GPU=true -t book-stitch .
```

You'll also need to uncomment the `deploy.resources` section in your `docker-compose.yml` to expose the GPU to the container. See the example compose file for details.

#### Version tagging

The build accepts an `APP_VERSION` arg that controls the version displayed in the dashboard. Defaults to `dev` if not set.

```bash
docker build --build-arg APP_VERSION=1.0.0 -t book-stitch .
```

### Local development

Prerequisites: Python 3.11+, ffmpeg

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
mkdir -p data
alembic upgrade head
python -m src.web_server
```

The server starts at `http://localhost:4477`. The database is created at `data/database.db`.

Tests run with pytest:

```bash
pytest tests/
pytest tests/test_abs_socket_listener.py -v  # single file
```
